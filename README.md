# Porlog-15puzzle
A project developed for "Intelligenza Artificiale e Laboratorio" exam @ Universit√† degli Studi di Torino, CS master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

An implementation of the 15-puzzle solver using informed search algorithms like IDA* in Prolog.  
Given an initial scrambled board, the solver finds an optimal sequence of moves to reach the goal state.  
This repo showcases logic programming and search strategy skills.
